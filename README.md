# Heart Attack Prediction Model Comparison

## Overview

This project compares four different machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart attack occurrences based on patient data. The models used in this project are:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Random Forest**

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle: [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).

## Models

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used as a baseline model for binary classification. It is straightforward, interpretable, and provides a clear understanding of feature influences.

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

k-NN is a non-parametric method used for classification. It works well with non-linear decision boundaries and is simple to implement and understand.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

SVM is effective for high-dimensional spaces and can handle non-linear relationships using different kernel functions. It maximizes the margin between classes, which can lead to better generalization.

### Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting. It also provides insights into feature importance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset). It includes various features related to heart health and demographics that are useful for predicting the likelihood of a heart attack.
